# ADMIN_URL as positional parameters or will read them from environment variables that are 
# set before calling this script. If SERVER_NAME is not sent as a parameter or exists with a value
# as an environment variable the script will EXIT. If the ADMIN_URL value cannot be determined
# by reading a parameter or from the environment a default value will be used.
