============

CodeMash v2.0.1.5 session decks, sample code, links and other stuff.

Speakers: please feel free to send me pull requests with any of your content that you want to share with the CodeMash attendees.  This way we have a single place for attendees to go and get content.

Organization: clone this repository and put your session materials, links or anything else in a subdirectory named with the same name as your session.  See the sample for an example of how it could work.
