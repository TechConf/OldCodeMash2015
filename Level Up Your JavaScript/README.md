# Level Up Your JavaScript!
### by Anthony Bennett
#### Originally presented at CodeMash on 2015/01/08

## Abstract

You've been using jQuery for years. You've got a well-worn handful
of plugins and libraries you pull off the shelf to solve common
problems. (Or you know how to Google for a new one when you need
it.) Maybe you're even into MVC (Angular, Backbone, Knockout, etc.)
or use RequireJS. But do you really know JavaScript? Have you ever
read through some of that third-party code? Do you understand "this"?
What's an IIFE? What does "use strict" do? How do you use Promises?
Come to a deeper understanding of these topics - and more - and you
too can level up your JavaScript!
