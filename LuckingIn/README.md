**Teaser**

In 2003, a new hire at Microsoft was happily toiling away in obscurity working on an online service. On nights and weekends, he built a little tool to help the team test the site. And then things got interesting. In this talk, Fiddler-builder Eric Lawrence explains how Fiddler grew from a rough side-project to a powerful and popular tool used by millions worldwide. After a brief overview of its technical evolution, the session covers never-before-revealed details about how Fiddler “escaped” from Microsoft and the long and stressful acquisition process. He shares lessons learned, what he’d do differently today, and inspiration for others hoping to convert their passion into their full-time job. If you’ve ever wanted to peek “behind the scenes,” you’ll enjoy this session.
